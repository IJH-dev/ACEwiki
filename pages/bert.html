                <!-- Intro Text -->
                <strong>Bert</strong>, also known by his nickname <strong>"Bertdizzle"</strong>, is a longtime member and the server‚Äôs resident stoner philosopher. He is known for his laid-back attitude and love for all things chill.
                <br>
                <br>
                Bert is a master of the art of relaxation, often seen lounging around with a joint in hand and a smile on his face. He has a unique ability to turn even the most mundane conversations into deep philosophical discussions, often leaving others scratching their heads in confusion.
                <br>
                <br>
                Frequently heard mumbling food reviews or falling asleep mid-sentence, Bert has carved out a reputation for chilled
                vibes, surprising wisdom, and consistent chaos.
            </p>
            <!-- Section 1 -->
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Bert joined the Discord on <strong>May 17, 2021</strong>. From the start, he made an impression with his unbothered
                attitude, encyclopedic knowledge of marijuana, and near-constant state of sleep deprivation. Though not always fully
                awake, Bert was quick to become one of the most recognized voices in late-night voice channels.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Section 2 -->
            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>
                Known for his mellow tone and unmatched ability to derail a conversation in the funniest way possible, Bert is
                considered the server‚Äôs spiritual guide for the perpetually tired. He‚Äôs the type to forget what day it is but give
                you a life-changing take on pineapple soda. His iconic quote ‚Äî <strong>"I haven't even slept yet..."</strong> ‚Äî is
                used by others to measure their own sleep schedules.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Section 3 -->
            <h3>Online Presence</h3>
            <p>
                Though Twitch isn‚Äôt a regular haunt, Bert occasionally appears on streams, usually as background chaos or comic
                relief. His presence is less about gameplay and more about the vibes ‚Äî and sometimes questionable mic quality.
            </p>
