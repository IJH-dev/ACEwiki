            <!-- Intro Text -->
            <p>
                <strong>Carlos</strong>, known on the server as <strong>c loading...</strong>, is a mysterious yet active figure
                often found lurking in voice chats and hate-watching streams. Despite his cryptic tag and unpredictable presence,
                Carlos has made a name for himself through sharp one-liners, relentless sarcasm, and moments of accidental comedy
                gold.
                <br>
                <br>
                Referred to as <strong>"Rats"</strong> by most, Carlos is both a background menace and a reliable contributor to the
                chaos. His interactions are often brief but unforgettable, and his dry delivery of the phrase <strong>"Bing
                    Chilling"</strong> has become a running meme in the server.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Section 1 -->
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Carlos joined the Discord on <strong>November 13, 2022</strong>. While his early presence was relatively low-key, it
                didn’t take long for him to become associated with ironic commentary, unmuted chewing sounds, and sudden mic
                activity when drama is unfolding. His evolution from silent observer to “Hate Watcher” has been seamless.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Section 2 -->
            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>
                Carlos embodies a unique blend of low-effort chaos and high-impact presence. While he rarely starts conversations,
                he somehow always finishes them. His nickname <strong>"Rats"</strong> is still shrouded in mystery, but somehow...
                it just fits. He's often there — mic muted, profile idle — until he randomly erupts with something that derails
                everything.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Section 3 -->
            <h3>Online Presence</h3>
            <p>
                Though an occasional content creator, Carlos is a frequent attendee in streams — specifically to hate-watch. His commentary
                is usually typed in chat or muttered quietly into the mic with a well-timed sigh. His Twitch presence is purely
                observational, yet oddly essential.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Section 4 -->
            <h3>Notable Moments</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Said “Bing Chilling” 14 times in one stream and then left</li>
                <li>Randomly joined VC during an argument just to say “y’all weird”</li>
                <li>Once unmuted only to eat chips, then left again</li>
            </ul>
