            <!-- Intro Text -->
            <strong>Jesse</strong>, known in the server as <strong>Jesse1k</strong>, is a certified wild card. Whether it’s
            throwing outlandish takes, gambling on impossible odds, or vanishing for days, Jesse’s presence is always felt —
            even when he’s not around. He lives up to his nickname <strong>"The Risk Taker"</strong> with questionable bets and
            even more questionable luck.
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite his chaotic energy, Jesse has become a core part of the server’s identity. He rarely wins, but that’s never
            stopped him from trying again. His most iconic line — <strong>"Dumb, bitch"</strong> — is delivered with a mix of
            frustration and deadpan flair, usually after losing a game or a bet he never should’ve taken.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Section 1 -->
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            Jesse joined the Discord on <strong>May 20, 2021</strong>. From the beginning, he positioned himself as the gambler
            of the group — taking risks in games, in arguments, and in VC antics. His luck, however, remains legendarily bad.
            Over time, his losses have become a running joke, yet somehow also a badge of honor.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Section 2 -->
        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p>
            Jesse thrives in chaos. He’s unpredictable, loud when he chooses to be, and often the source of both the funniest
            and most frustrating moments in a single night. As a <em>Lurker</em>, he often appears without warning — typing
            something inflammatory, joining a call, then vanishing back into the void.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <h3>Online Presence</h3>
        <p>
            Jesse doesn’t stream often, but when he does, it’s typically filled with reckless decisions and hilarious
            self-destruction. Whether he's betting channel points or instigating arguments, his Twitch behavior mirrors his
            Discord persona: chaotic neutral with a splash of cursed energy.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Section 4 -->
        <h3>Notable Moments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bet all his channel points on a 10% win chance — lost immediately</li>
            <li>Joined VC just to scream “I’m back!” — then disconnected</li>
            <li>Accidentally muted himself for an hour while trash talking</li>
        </ul>
