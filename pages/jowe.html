                    <!-- Intro text -->
                    <strong>Jowe</strong>, also known by his nickname <strong>"The Negosh"</strong>, is the enigmatic server owner of the Discord.
                    Known for his strategic silences and uncanny ability to bait rage in the most composed users, Jowe has become a
                    legend in his own right within the community.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite holding the role of <em>Server Owner</em>, Jowe is often described as a "hands-off leader," preferring to
                    watch the chaos unfold rather than directly intervene. His cryptic presence is marked by his trademark greeting —
                    <strong>"Hello, Hello"</strong> — usually followed by total radio silence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Many believe Jowe’s Twitch alias, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thenegotiatorace" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">TheNegotiatorace</a>, is where his true personality shines. Those brave enough to
                    engage in a voice chat with him often leave with more questions than answers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He joined the server on <strong>May 21, 2021</strong>, and since then has played a vital role in shaping the
                    server's culture — for better or worse.
                </p>
                <!-- Section 1 -->
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Jowe joined the Discord on <strong>May 21, 2021</strong>. Little is known about his early days, but his rise to
                    Server Owner was marked by a mix of mystery and mild chaos. His leadership style is as unconventional as his
                    sporadic appearances.
                </p>
                
                <!-- Section 2 -->
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Often silent but always watching, Jowe is best described as a master of the long game. He rarely speaks, but when he
                    does, it’s either to bait a reaction or deliver a cryptic one-liner. His favorite greeting — <strong>"Hello,
                        Hello"</strong> — is now feared across channels.
                </p>
                
                <!-- Section 3 -->
                <h3>Online Presence</h3>
                <p>
                    Under the Twitch alias <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thenegotiatorace" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">TheNegotiatorace</a>, Jowe streams on occasion. However, the streams are just as
                    unpredictable as he is, often starting with long idle periods or spontaneous rants about controller aim assist.
                </p>
